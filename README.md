# Realtime Trip Planner System

## Project Agenda
Build an End-to-End Agentic AI Project using:
- Langchain
- Langraph
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Agentic RAG
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Other relevant libraries and frameworks (e.g., uv)

### Prerequisites
- Python (modular programming)
- Langchain, Langraph, RAG, Agentic RAG, MCP
- NLP, Deep Learning, Generative AI

## Problem Statement
Design and implement an agentic AI application for a **Realtime Trip Planner System**. The goal is to enable AI agents to collaborate and solve complex travel planning workflows in real time. The system should leverage agentic RAG and graph-based mechanisms (Langraph) to optimize trip planning, adapt to changing requirements, and provide intelligent recommendations.

## Project Structure

### Project Setup with uv

1. Check your uv version:
    ```
    uv --version
    ```
    This command displays the installed uv version. If uv is not installed, visit the official site: [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

2. Initialize a new project:
    ```
    uv init project_name
    ```
    This will automatically create a new project structure.

3. Change to the project directory:
    ```
    cd project_name
    ```

4. Open the project in VS Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```

- **Main:** Agentic AI Application
     - AI agents collaborate with other AI agents to solve complex workflows
     - Langraph: Mechanism using graph API for agent collaboration

### Key Concepts
- **Nodes:** Fundamental units representing tasks, agents, or data sources in the graph
- **Edges:** Connections between nodes, representing relationships or data flow
- **Stategraph:** The evolving state of the system as agents interact and solve tasks

## Implementation & Deployment
- Full project implementation
- Deployment using LLMOps best practices
